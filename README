This is an rpi thermostat code.

Ideally, this will be simple and stupid.

I've implemented a really dumb Flask web controlling interface. This should be prettified and made mobile friendly.
As of yet there's no code for actually flipping the relays, talking to the temperature sensor, logging data, or plotting it.

schedule.txt format:
0-4 20, 4-16 80F, 16-24 20
00-24 24
00-24 24
00-24 24
00-24 24
00-24 24
00-24 24

on monday:
From midnight to 4 am, goal 20 degC
from 4am to 4 pm, goal 80 degF
from 4pm to midnight, goal 20 degC

every other day of week:
24 degC goal constant

Desired features:
    sets temp from schedule file
    easy to change schedule (web app?)
    logs info (plot with plotly?)
    can heat and cool
